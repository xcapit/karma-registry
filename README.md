#Karma Registry

**Karma Registry** is a public reputation platform for humanitarian NGOs, developed during the [HackMeridian 2025](https://www.stellar.org/events/meridian) hackathon. It leverages Stellar smart contracts, Reflector Oracles, and decentralized identity protocols (DID + VC) to bring transparency, trust, and verifiability to the humanitarian aid sector.

## What is Karma Registry?

Karma Registry enables NGOs to receive a dynamic, verifiable **reputation score** based on a combination of on-chain and off-chain data:

- **SoulBound Tokens (SBTs)** represent the verified identity and trust level of each organization.
- A **Trust Index** is calculated based on on-chain aid transactions, beneficiary verification, audit submissions, and operational capacity.
- All credentials and claims are anchored on-chain using Stellar smart contracts and validated through Reflector Oracles.

---

## Key Features

-  **SoulBound Token issuance** after KYB verification
- Dynamic, transparent **Trust Index**
- **Reflector Oracles** for audit validation, price feeds, and contextual data (climate, region)
- Currency normalization across local fiat and crypto using on-chain oracles
- **Decentralized Identity** using Veramo agents + Verifiable Credentials (W3C standard)

---

## Tech Stack

- **Smart Contracts**: [Soroban](https://soroban.stellar.org/) (Stellar WASM)
- **Oracle Layer**: [Reflector](https://reflector.network/)
- **Identity Layer**: [Veramo](https://veramo.io/) — off-chain DID/VC agent
- **Blockchain**: Stellar 

---

## Architecture Overview

1. NGOs complete KYB and link a Stellar wallet.
2. A **SoulBound Token** is issued on-chain to represent their identity.
3. Humanitarian program data is ingested and indexed.
4. **Reflector Oracles** validate off-chain reports and normalize aid value using price feeds.
5. A real-time **Trust Index** is calculated based on a weighted formula.
6. DIDs and Verifiable Credentials are managed off-chain with **Veramo**, while hashes are anchored on Stellar to ensure tamper-proof attestations.

## Roadmap

| Phase | Feature Set |
|-------|-------------|
| Phase 1 | KYB flow, SBT minting, dashboard UI, testnet deployment |
| Phase 2 | Reflector Oracle integration: audits, price feeds, climate/territory context |
| Phase 3 | Decentralized Identity (DID/VC) with Veramo + cross-org credential registry |

> Only **Phase 1** is being delivered as part of the Hackathon.  
> Phases 2 and 3 are part of the extended development roadmap.
