# 🌍 Karma Registry

**Karma Registry** is a public reputation platform for humanitarian NGOs, developed during the [HackMeridian 2025](https://www.stellar.org/events/meridian) hackathon. It leverages Stellar smart contracts, Reflector Oracles, and decentralized identity protocols (DID + VC) to bring transparency, trust, and verifiability to the humanitarian aid sector.

## 💡 What is Karma Registry?

Karma Registry enables NGOs to receive a dynamic, verifiable **reputation score** based on a combination of on-chain and off-chain data:

- **SoulBound Tokens (SBTs)** represent the verified identity and trust level of each organization.
- A **Trust Index** is calculated based on on-chain aid transactions, beneficiary verification, audit submissions, and organizational capacity.
- All credentials and claims are anchored on-chain using Stellar smart contracts and validated through Reflector Oracles.

---

## 🔐 Key Features

- ✅ **SoulBound Token issuance** after KYB verification  
- 📊 Dynamic and transparent **Trust Index**  
- 🔗 **Reflector Oracles** for audit validation, price feeds, and contextual data (climate, region)  
- 💱 Currency normalization across fiat and crypto using on-chain oracles  
- 🪪 **Decentralized Identity** via Veramo agents + Verifiable Credentials (W3C standard)  

---

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- **Smart Contracts**: [Soroban](https://soroban.stellar.org/) (Stellar WASM)
- **Oracle Layer**: [Reflector](https://reflector.network/)
- **Identity Layer**: [Veramo](https://veramo.io/) — off-chain DID/VC agent
- **Blockchain**: Stellar

---

## 🛠 Architecture Overview

1. NGOs complete KYB and link a Stellar wallet.
2. A **SoulBound Token** is issued on-chain to represent their identity.
3. Humanitarian program data is ingested and indexed.
4. **Reflector Oracles** validate off-chain reports and normalize aid value using price feeds.
5. A real-time **Trust Index** is calculated based on a weighted formula.
6. DIDs and Verifiable Credentials are managed off-chain with **Veramo**, while hashes are anchored on Stellar to ensure tamper-proof attestations.

## 🗺 Roadmap

| Phase     | Feature Set                                                                 |
|-----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Phase 1 ✅ | KYB flow, SBT minting, dashboard UI, testnet deployment                     |
| Phase 2   | Reflector Oracle integration: audits, price feeds, climate/territory context |
| Phase 3   | Decentralized Identity (DID/VC) with Veramo + cross-org credential registry  |

> Only **Phase 1** is being delivered as part of the Hackathon.  
> Phases 2 and 3 are part of the extended development roadmap.
